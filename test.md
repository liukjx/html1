　　1)  A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys. People art actually more stressed at home than at work. Researchers measured people's cortisol. Which is it at stress marker. While they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.

　　2)  "Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home," writes one of the researchers. Sarah Damaske, In fact women say they feel better at work. She notes. "it is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work," Another surprise is that the findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why people who work outside the home have better health.

　　3) What the study doesn't measure is whether people are still doing work when they' re at home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home, they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women, it' s not surprising that women are more stressed at home.

　　4) But it's not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what they're supposed to be doing: working, making money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure: Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.

　　5) On the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most of them. Your home colleagues-your family-have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it, or if they' re teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they' re your family. You cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.

　　6) So it's not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the tasks apparently infinite, the co-workers are much harder to motivate.

　　21.According to Paragraph 1，most previous surveys found that home___________

　　[A] offered greater relaxation than the workplace

　　[B] was an ideal place for stress measurement

　　[C] generated more stress than the workplace

　　[D] was an unrealistic place for relaxation

　　22.According to Damaske， who are likely to be the happiest at home?

　　[A] Working mothers

　　[B] Childless husbands

　　[C] Working fathers

　　[D] Childless wives

　　23 The blurring of working women's roles refers to the fact that_____.

　　[A] their home is also a place for kicking back

　　[B] they are both bread winners and housewives

　　[C] there is often much housework left behind

　　[D] it is difficult for them to leave their office

　　24.The word "moola" ( Para 4) most probably means_____.

　　[A] skills

　　[B] energy

　　[C] earnings

　　[D] nutrition

　　25.The home front differs from the workplace in that______.

　　[A] family labor is often adequately rewarded

　　[B] home is hardly a cozier working environment

　　[C]household tasks are generally more motivating

　　[D] division of labor at home is seldom clear-cut

　　1)  In an essay entitled “Making It in America”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,” a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.”

　　2)  Davidson’s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign worker.

　　3)  In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job，could earn an average lifestyle ,But ,today ,average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra-their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

　　4)  Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’s been an acceleration. As Davidson notes,” In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs-about 6 million in total -disappeared.

　　5)  There will always be changed-new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.

　　6)  In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I.Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to poet-high school education.

　　21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate_______

　　[A] the impact of technological advances

　　[B] the alleviation of job pressure

　　[C] the shrinkage of textile mills

　　[D] the decline of middle-class incomes

　　22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to______

　　[A] work on cheap software

　　[B] ask for a moderate salary

　　[C] adopt an average lifestyle

　　[D] contribute something unique

　　23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that ______

　　[A] gains of technology have been erased

　　[B] job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed

　　[C] factories are making much less money than before

　　[D] new jobs and services have been offered

　　24. According to the author, to reduce unemployment, the most important is_____

　　[A] to accelerate the I.T. revolution

　　[B] to ensure more education for people

　　[C] to advance economic globalization

　　[D] to pass more bills in the 21st century

　　25. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text?

　　[A] New Law Takes Effect

　　[B] Technology Goes Cheap

　　[C] Average Is Over

　　[D] Recession Is Bad

　　1) For the first time in history, more people live in towns than in the county. In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal firmly, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support.

　　2) A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” Hill’s pressure later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. It needs constant guardianship.

　　3) At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priori over conservation, even authorizing “off-plan” building where local people might object. The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The Liberal Democrats are silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Conservative parties.

　　4) The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are.in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents Stirling Ackroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone, no intrusion on green belt. What is true of London is even truer of the provinces.

　　5) The idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need for more house but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town shopping sites against. high streets. This is not a free market but a biased one. Rural towns and villages have growl and will always grow. They do so best where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not ruin urban conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones?

　　6) Development should be planned .not let rip. After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. there is no doubt of the alternative - the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal Spain or Ireland avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite left and right of the political spectrum.

　　26. Britain’s public sentiment about the countryside_____.

　　[A] didn’t start till the Shakespearean age.

　　[B] has brought much benefit to the NHS.

　　[C] is fully backed by the royal family.

　　[D] is not well reflected in politics.

　　27. According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust are now being_____.

　　[A] gradually destroyed.

　　[B] effectively reinforced.

　　[C] largely overshadowed.

　　[D] properly protected.

　　28. Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3?

　　[A] Labour is under attack for opposing development

　　[B] The Conservatives may abandon “off-plan” building.

　　[C] The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence.

　　[D] Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation.

　　29. The author holds that George Osborne’s preference_____.

　　[A] reveals a strong prejudice against urban areas.

　　[B] shows his disregard for the character of rural areas.

　　[C] stresses the necessity of easing the housing crisis.

　　[D] highlights his firm stand i against lobby Pressure.

　　30. In the last paragraph, the author shows his appreciation of _____.

　　[A] the size of population in Britain.

　　[B] the enviable urban lifestyle in Britain.

　　[C] the town-and-country planning in Britain.

　　[D]the political life in today’s Britain.

　　1) What would you do with $590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings of fulfilment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton.

　　2) These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once exciting and new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms Dunn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time-as stories or memories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.

　　3) This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most" happiness bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it). Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.

　　4) Readers of “Happy Money”are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfilment, not hunger. Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors’ policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent.

　　21. According to Dunn and Norton, which of the following is the most rewarding purchase?

　　[A]A big house

　　[B]A special tour

　　[C]A stylish car

　　[D]A rich meal

　　22. The author’s attitude toward Americans’ watching TV is________.

　　[A]critical

　　[B]supportive

　　[C]sympathetic

　　[D]ambiguous

　　23. McRib is mentioned in paragraph 3 to show that_______.

　　[A] consumers are sometimes irrational

　　[B] popularity usually comes after quality

　　[C] marketing tricks are after effective

　　[D]rarity generally increases pleasure

　　24. According to the last paragraph, Happy Money_______.

　　[A] has left much room for readers’criticism

　　[B] may prove to be a worth while purchase

　　[C] has predicted a wider income gap in the us

　　[D] may give its readers a sense of achievement

　　25. This text mainly discusses how to______.

　　[A] balance feeling good and spending money

　　[B] spend large sums of money won in lotteries

　　[C] obtain lasting satisfaction from money spent

　　[D] become more reasonable in spending on luxuries

When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his 
explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual 
vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving "to pursue my goal of 
running a company." Broadcasting his ambition was "very much my decision," 
McGee says. Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of 
Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on 
September 29. 
McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what 
kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world 
about his aspirations. And McGee isn't alone. In recent weeks the No.2 executives at 
Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a 
CEO post. As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, 
executives who don't get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business 
environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements 
cloud their reputations. 
As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more 
willing to make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 
23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to 
Liberum Research. As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring 
leaders. 
The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. 
For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive 
CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner 
Dennis Carey: "I can't think of a single search I've done where a board has not 
instructed me to look at sitting CEOs first." 
Those who jumped without a job haven't always landed in top positions quickly. 
Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade ago, saying she wanted to be a CEO. 
It was a year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. 
Robert Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took 
that post at a major financial institution three years later. 
Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial 
crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. "The 
traditional rule was it's safer to stay where you are, but that's been fundamentally 
inverted," says one headhunter. "The people who've been hurt the worst are those 
who've stayed too long." 

   
 
26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being 
[A] arrogant. 
[B] frank. 
[C] self-centered. 
[D] impulsive. 
 
27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives' quitting may be spurredby 
[A] their expectation of better financial status. 
[B] their need to reflect on their private life. 
[C] their strained relations with the boards. 
[D] their pursuit of new career goals. 
 
28. The word "poached" (Line 3, Paragraph 4) most probably means 
[A] approved of. 
[B] attended to. 
[C] hunted for. 
[D] guarded against. 
 
29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that 
[A] top performers used to cling to their posts. 
[B] loyalty of top performers is getting out-dated. 
[C] top performers care more about reputations. 
[D] it's safer to stick to the traditional rules. 
 
30. Which of the following is the best title for the text? 
[A] CEOs: Where to Go? 
[B] CEOs: All the Way Up? 
[C] Top Managers Jump without a Net 
[D] The Only Way Out for Top Performers

The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next 
music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden 
announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been 
favorable, to say the least. "Hooray! At last!" wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober- 
sided classical-music critic. 
One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is 
that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated 
Gilbert's appointment in the Times, calls him "an unpretentious musician with no air 
of the formidable conductor about him." As a description of the next music director of 
an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre 
Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise. 
For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good 
one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it 
is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear 
interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my 
computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes. 
Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live 
performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art- 
loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, 
dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded 
performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. These recordings 
are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than 
today's live performances; moreover, they can be "consumed" at a time and place of 
the listener's choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus 
brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert. 
One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new 
music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert's own interest in new music has been 
widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is 
capable of turning the Philharmonic into "a markedly different, more vibrant 
organization." But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the 
orchestra's repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to 
succeed, they must first change the relationship between America's oldest orchestra 
and the new audience it hopes to attract. 

   
 
21. We learn from Paragraph 1 that Gilbert's appointment has 
[A] incurred criticism. 
[B] raised suspicion. 
[C] received acclaim. 
[D] aroused curiosity. 
 
22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is 
[A] influential. 
[B] modest. 
[C] respectable. 
[D] talented. 
 
23. The author believes that the devoted concertgoers 
[A] ignore the expenses of live performances. 
[B] reject most kinds of recorded performances. 
[C] exaggerate the variety of live performances. 
[D] overestimate the value of live performances. 
 
24. According to the text, which of the following is true ofrecordings? 
[A] They are often inferior to live concerts in quality. 
[B] They are easily accessible to the general public. 
[C] They help improve the quality of music. 
[D] They have only covered masterpieces. 
 
25. Regarding Gilbert's role in revitalizing the Philharmonic, the author feels 
[A] doubtful. 
[B] enthusiastic. 
[C] confident. 
[D] puzzled.

　　1)  With so much focus on children's use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use. “Tech is designed to really suck on you in,” says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play, “and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.”

　　2) Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who used devices during the exercise started 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.

　　3)  Infants are wired to look at parents' faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive — as they often are when absorbed in a device — it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment” devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother's attention. “Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,” says Radesky.

　　4) On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an "oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting" with their children: “It's based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you're failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.” Tronick believes that just because a child isn't learning from the screen doesn't mean there's no value to it—particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their child the rest of the time.

　　26. According to Jenny Radesky, digital products are designed to ______.

　　[A] simplify routine matters

　　[B] absorb user attention

　　[C] better interpersonal relations

　　[D] increase work efficiency

　　27. Radesky's food-testing exercise shows that mothers' use of devices ______.

　　[A] takes away babies' appetite

　　[B] distracts children's attention

　　[C] slows down babies' verbal development

　　[D] reduces mother-child communication

　　28. Radesky's cites the "still face experiment" to show that _______.

　　[A] it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions

　　[B] verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange

　　[C] children are insensitive to changes in their parents' mood

　　[D] parents need to respond to children's emotional needs

　　29. The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to_______.

　　[A] protect kids from exposure to wild fantasies

　　[B] teach their kids at least 30,000 words a year

　　[C] ensure constant interaction with their children

　　[D] remain concerned about kid's use of screens

　　30. According to Tronick, kid's use of screens may_______.

　　[A] give their parents some free time

　　[B] make their parents more creative

　　[C] help them with their homework

　　[D] help them become more attentive

　　1) Many people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reported for Jure, along with the drop in the unemployment take to 6 J percent. at good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace.

　　2) However, there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked. There was a big jump in the number of people who report voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000（4,4 percent）above its year ago level.

　　3) Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.

　　4)      There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000(7.9 percent) from its year ago level.

　　5) We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The survey used by the Labor Department asks people if they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the answer is "yes." they are classified as working part-time. The survey then asks whether they worked less than 35 hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice. They are only classified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.

　　6) The issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment. For many people, especially those with serious health conditions or family members with serious health conditions, before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance.

　　7) However, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance.

　　36. Which part of the jobs picture was neglected?

　　[A] The prospect of a thriving job market.

　　[B] The increase of voluntary part-time jobs.

　　[C] The possibility of full employment.

　　[D] The acceleration of job creation.

　　37. Many people work part-time because they_____.

　　[A] prefer part-time jobs to full-time jobs

　　[B] feel that is enough to make ends meet

　　[C] cannot get their hands on full-time jobs

　　[D] haven' t seen the weakness of the market

　　38. Involuntary part-time employment in the US_____.

　　[A] shows a general tendency of decline

　　[B] is harder to acquire than one year ago

　　[C] satisfies the real need of the jobless

　　[D] is lower than before the recession

　　39. It can be learned that with Obamacare_____.

　　[A] it is no longer easy for part-timers to get insurance

　　[B] full-time employment is still essential for insurance

　　[C] it is still challenging to get insurance for family members

　　[D] employment is no longer a precondition to get insurance

　　40. The text mainly discusses_____.

　　[A] employment in the US

　　[B] part-timer classification

　　[C] insurance through Medicaid

　　[D] Obamacare's trouble

　　1) If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil servant. When Hoffa’s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in America’s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. In Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized.

　　2) There are three reasons for the public-sector unions’ thriving. First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. Some of their ties go back a long way. Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector unions.

　　3) At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California points out that much of the state’s budget is patrolled by unions. The teachers’ unions keep an eye on schools, the CCPOA on prisons and a variety of labor groups on health care.

　　4) In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private one. But the real gains come in benefits and work practices. Politicians have repeatedly “backloaded” public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.

　　5) Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles. Even though there is plenty of evidence that the quality of the teachers is the most important variable, teachers’ unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and promoting good ones.

　　6) As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have begun to clamp down. In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of supporters against Scott Walker, the hardline Republican governor. But many within the public sector suffer under the current system, too.

　　7)  John Donahue at Harvard’s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. Bankers’ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America.

　　36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that _____.

　　[A] Teamsters still have a large body of members.

　　[B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant.

　　[C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership.

　　[D] the government has improved its relationship with unionists.

　　37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2?

　　[A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions.

　　[B] Education is required for public-sector union membership.

　　[C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions.

　　[D] Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions.

　　38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state sector is _____.

　　[A] illegally secured.

　　[B] indirectly augmented.

1) The concept of man versus machine is at least as old as the industrial revolution, but this phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries. And yet, it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painful side of a boom and bust cycle. Certain jobs have gone away for eating up human jobs, this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy in ways we can’t immediately foresee.

　　2)  When there is exponential improvement in the price and performance of technology, jobs that were once thought to be immune from automation suddenly become threatened. This argument has attracted a lot of attention, via the success of the book Race Against the Machine, by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who both hail from MIT’s Center for Digital Business.

　　3) This is a powerful argument, and a scary one. And yet, John Hagel, author of The Power of Pull and other books, says Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason why these jobs are so vulnerable to technology in the first place.

　　4) Hagel says we have designed jobs in the U.S. that tend to be “tightly scripted” and “highly standardized” ones that leave no room for “individual initiative or creativity.” In short, these are the types of jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings. That is how we have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers, Hagel says.

　　5) It’s time to reinvent the formula for how work is conducted, since we are still relying on a very 20th century notion of work, Hagel says. In our rapidly changing economy, we more than ever need people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise their imagination “to respond to unexpected events.” That’s not something machines are good at. They are designed to perform very predictable activities.

　　6) As Hagel notes, Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point in their book. We need to reframe race against the machine as race with the machine. In our works, we need to look at the ways in which machines can augment human labor rather than replace it. So then the problem is not really about technology, but rather, “how do we innovate our institutions and our work practices?”

　　31.According to the first paragraph, economic downturns would ______.

　　[A] ease the competition of man vs. machine

　　[B] highlight machines’ threat to human jobs

　　[C] provoke a painful technological revolution

　　[D] outmode our current economic structure

　　32. The authors of Race Against the Machine argue that______.

　　[A] technology is diminishing man’s job opportunities

　　[B] automation is accelerating technological development

　　[C] certain jobs will remain intact after automation

　　[D] man will finally win the race against machine

　　33. Hagel argues that jobs in the U.S. are often ______.

　　[A] performed by innovative minds

　　[B] scripted with an individual style

　　[C] standardized without a clear target

　　[D] designed against human creativity

　　34.According to the last paragraph, Brynjolfsson and McAfee discussed______.

　　[A] the predictability of machine behavior in practice

　　[B] the formula for how work is conducted efficiently

　　[C] the ways machines replace human labor in modern times

　　[D] the necessity of human involvement in the workplace

　　35. Which of the following could be the most appropriate title for text?

　　[A] How to Innovate Our Work Practices

　　[B] Machines will Replace Human Labor

　　[C] Can We Win the Race Against Machines

　　[D] Economic Downturns Stimulate Innovations

　　1)  Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely — though by no means uniformly — glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives of fulfilment and opportunity for all.

　　2)  Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu to climate change. You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.

　　3)  But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years — so why shouldn’t we? Take a broader look at our species’ place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years. Look up Homo sapiens in the “Red List” of threatened species of the International for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN), and you will read: “Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline.”

　　4) So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long Now Foundation has as its flagship project a mechanical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years hence.

　　5) Perhaps willfully, it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today’s technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it’s perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That’s one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.

　　6)  But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants will find themselves.

　　7)  This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a passing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.

　　31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by _____.

　　[A] our desire for lives of fulfilment.

　　[B] our faith in science and technology.

　　[C] our awareness of potential risks.

　　[D] our belief in equal opportunity.

　　32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggests that human beings are _____.

　　[A] a sustained species.

　　[B] the world’s dominant power.

　　[C] a threat to the environment.

　　[D] a misplaced race.

　　33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?

　　[A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.

　　[B] Technology offers solutions to social problem.

　　[C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.

　　[D] Our immediate future is hard to conceive.

　　34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to _____.

　　[A] explore our planet’s abundant resources.

　　[B] adopt an optimistic view of the world.

　　[C] draw on our experience from the past.

　　[D] curb our ambition to reshape history.

　　35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

　　[A] Uncertainty about Our Future

　　[B] Evolution of the Human Species

　　[C] The Ever-bright Prospects of Mankind

　　[D] Science, Technology and Humanity

　　1) King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted “kings don’t abdicate, they dare in their sleep.” But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So, does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyle?

　　2) The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above “mere” politics and “embody” a spirit of national unity.

　　3) It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs’ continuing popularity polarized. And also, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.

　　4)  Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history—and sometimes the way they behave today – embodies outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.

　　5)  The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.

　　6) While Europe’s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.

　　7) It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy’s reputation with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service – as non-controversial and non-political heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy’s worst enemies.

　　21. According to the first two Paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain_____.

　　[A] used turn enjoy high public support

　　[B] was unpopular among European royals

　　[C] cased his relationship with his rivals

　　[D] ended his reign in embarrassment

　　22. Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly_____.

　　[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status

　　[B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality

　　[C] to give voter more public figures to look up to

　　[D]due to their everlasting political embodiment

　　23. Which of the following is shown to be odd, according to Paragraph 4?

　　[A] Aristocrats’ excessive reliance on inherited wealth

　　[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies

　　[C] The simple lifestyle of the aristocratic families

　　[D]The nobility’s adherence to their privileges

　　24. The British royals “have most to fear” because Charles_____.

　　[A] takes a rough line on political issues

　　[B] fails to change his lifestyle as advised

　　[C] takes republicans as his potential allies

　　[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role

　　25. Which of the following is the best title of the text?

　　[A] Carlos, Glory and Disgrace Combined

　　[B] Charles, Anxious to Succeed to the Throne

　　[C] Carlos, a Lesson for All European Monarchs

　　[D]Charles, Slow to React to the Coming Threats

1)    Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.

　　2)    Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.

　　3)    The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.

　　4)    But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.

　　21. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for ______.

　　[A] gaining excessive profits

　　[B] failing to fulfill her duty

　　[C] refusing to make compromises

　　[D] leaving the board in tough times

　　22. We learn from Paragraph 2 that outside directors are supposed to be______.

　　[A]generous investors

　　[B]unbiased executives

　　[C]share price forecasters

　　[D]independent advisers

　　23. According to the researchers from Ohio University after an outside director’s surprise departure, the firm is likely to______.

　　[A]become more stable

　　[B]report increased earnings

　　[C]do less well in the stock market

　　[D]perform worse in lawsuits

　　24. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors______.

　　[A]may stay for the attractive offers from the firm

　　[B]have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm

　　[C]are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm

　　[D]will decline incentives from the firm

　　25. The author’s attitude toward the role of outside directors is______.

　　[A]permissive

　　[B]positive

　　[C]scornful

　　[D]critical

　　1) Progressives often support diversity mandates as a path to equality and a way to level the playing field. But all too often such policies are an insincere form of virtue-signaling that benefits only the most privileged and does little to help average people.

　　2）A pair of bills sponsored by Massachusetts state Senator Jason Lewis and House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, to ensure “gender parity” on boards and commissions, provide a case in point.

　　3) Haddad and Lewis are concerned that more than half the state-government boards are less than 40 percent female. In order to ensure that elite women have more such opportunities, they have proposed imposing government quotas. If the bills become law, state boards and commissions will be required to set aside 50 percent of board seats for women by 2022.

　　4) The bills are similar to a measure recently adopted in California, which last year became the first state to require gender quotas for private companies. In signing the measure, California Governor Jerry Brown admitted that the law, which expressly classifies people on the basis of sex, is probably unconstitutional.

　　5) The US Supreme Court frowns on sex-based classifications unless they are designed to address an “important” policy interest, Because the California law applies to all boards, even where there is no history of prior discrimination, courts are likely to rule that the law violates the constitutional guarantee of “equal protection”.

　　6) But are such government mandates even necessary? Female participation on corporate boards may not currently mirror the percentage of women in the general population, but so what?

　　7) The number of women on corporate boards has been steadily increasing without government interference. According to a study by Catalyst, between 2010 and 2015 the share of women on the boards of global corporations increased by 54 percent.

　　8) Requiring companies to make gender the primary qualification for board membership will inevitably lead to less experienced private sector boards. That is exactly what happened when Norway adopted a nationwide corporate gender quota.

　　9) Writing in The New Republic, Alice Lee notes that increasing the number of opportunities for board membership without increasing the pool of qualified women to serve on such boards has led to a “golden skirt” phenomenon, where the same elite women scoop up multiple seats on a variety of boards.

　　10) Next time somebody pushes corporate quotas as a way to promote gender equity, remember that such policies are largely self-serving measures that make their sponsors feel good but do little to help average women.

　　31. The author believes hat the bills sponsored by Lewis and Haddad will

　　[A] help little to reduce gender bias.

　　[B] pose a threat to the state government.

　　[C] raise women’s position in politics.

　　[D] greatly broaden career options.

　　32. Which of the following is true of the California measure?

　　[A] It has irritated private business owners.

　　[B] It is welcomed by the Supreme Court.

　　[C]It may go against the Constitution.

　　[D] It will settle the prior controversies.

　　33. The author mentions the study by Catalyst to illustrate

　　[A] the harm from arbitrary board decision.

　　[B] the importance of constitutional guarantees.

　　[C] the pressure on women in global corporations.

　　[D] the needlessness of government interventions.

　　34. Norway’s adoption of a nationwide corporate gender quota has led to

　　[A] the underestimation of elite women’s role.

　　[B] the objection to female participation on bards.

　　[C] the entry of unqualified candidates into the board.

　　[D] the growing tension between Labor and management.

　　35. Which of the following can be inferred from the text?

　　[A] Women’s need in employment should be considered

　　[B] Feasibility should be a prime concern in policymaking.

　　[C] Everyone should try hard to promote social justice.

　　[D] Major social issues should be the focus of legislation.

1) Even in traditional offices，"the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much more emotional and much more right-brained than it was 20 years ago，" said Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn She started spinning off examples. "If you and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990，we would see much less frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals，there were strategies，there were objectives，but we didn't talk about energy；we didn't talk about passion."

　　2) Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very "team"-oriented-and not by coincidence. "Let's not forget sports-in male-dominated corporate America，it's still a big deal. It's not explicitly conscious；it's the idea that I'm a coach，and you're my team，and we're in this together. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies，but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win".

　　3) These terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning-and，as Khurana points out，increase allegiance to the firm." You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit organizations and religious organizations：Terms like vision，values，passion，and purpose，"said Khurana

　　4) This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work-life balance. The "mommy wars" of the 1990s are still going on today, prompting arguments about why women still can't have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In，whose title has become a buzzword in its own right. Terms like unplug，offline，life-hack，bandwidth，and capacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home. But if your work is your "passion," you' II be more likely to devote yourself to it，even if that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed.

　　5) But this seems to be the irony of office speak： Everyone makes fun of it，but managers love it，companies depend on it，and regular people willingly absorb it. As a linguist said，"You can get people to think it's nonsense at the same time that you buy into it." In a workplace that's fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work-and how your work defines who you are.

　　31. According to Nancy Koehn, office language has become_____.

　　[A] less strategic

　　[B] less energetic

　　[C] more objective

　　[D] more emotional

　　32."team"-oriented corporate vocabulary is closely related to_____.

　　[A] sports culture

　　[B] gender difference

　　[C] historical incidents

　　[D] athletic executives

　　33.Khurana believes that the importation of terminology aims to____.

　　[A] revive historical terms

　　[B] promote company image

　　[C] foster corporate cooperation

　　[D] strengthen employee loyalty

　　34.It can be inferred that Lean In____.

　　[A] voices for working women

　　[B] appeals to passionate workaholics

　　[C] triggers debates among mommies

　　[D] praises motivated employees

　　35.Which of the following statements is true about office speak?

　　[A] Linguists believe it to be nonsense

　　[B] Regular people mock it but accept it

　　[C] Companies find it to be fundamental

　　[D] Managers admire it but avoid it

　　1)  While fossil fuels-coal，oil，gas-still generate roughly 85 percent of the world’s energy supply, it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world：They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line.

　　2) Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables，especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.

　　3)  In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland，for example，wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world takes the lead，notably China and Europe，the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In March，for the first time，wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US，reported the US Energy Information Administration.

　　4)  President Trump has underlined fossil fuels-especially coal-as the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa，he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play well with many in Iowa，where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state’s electricity generation-and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers.

　　5)  The question“what happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?”has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely.

　　6) The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers，who are placing big bets on battery-powered electric vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years.

　　7)  While there’s a long way to go，the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up-perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change. What Washington does-or doesn’t do-to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought.

　　26. The word“plummeting”(Para.2)is closest in meaning to_____.

　　[A] stabilizing

　　[B] changing

　　[C] falling

　　[D] rising

　　27. According to Paragraph 3，the use of renewable energy in America_____.

　　[A] Its application has boosted battery storage.

　　[B] It is commonly used in car manufacturing.

　　[C] Its continuous supply is becoming a reality.

　　[D] Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult.

　　30.It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy_____.

　　[A] will bring the US closer to other countries

　　[B] will accelerate global environmental change

　　[C] is not really encouraged by the US government

　　[D] is not competitive enough with regard to its cost

　　1) Scientific publishing has long been a licence to print money. Scientists need journals in which to publish their research, so they will supply the articles without monetary reward. Other scientists perform the specialized work of peer review also for free, because it is a central element in the acquisition of status and the production of scientific knowledge.

　　2) With the content of papers secured for free, the publisher needs only find a market for its journal. Until this century, university libraries were not very price sensitive. Scientific publishers routinely report profit margins approaching 40% on their operations, at a time when the rest of the publishing industry is in an existential crisis.

　　3) The Dutch giant Elsevier, which claims to publish 25% of the scientific papers produced in the world, made profits of more than ?900m last year, while UK universities alone spent more than ?210m in 2016 to enable researchers to access their own publicly funded research; both figures seem to rise unstoppably despite increasingly desperate efforts to change them.

　　4) The most drastic, and thoroughly illegal, reaction has been the emergence of Sci-Hub, a kind of global photocopier for scientific papers, set up in 2012, which now claims to offer access to every paywalled article published since 2015. The success of Sci-Hub, which relies on researchers passing on copies they have themselves legally accessed, shows the legal ecosystem has lost legitimacy among is users and must be transformed so that it works for all participants.

　　5) In Britain the move towards open access publishing has been driven by funding bodies. In some ways it has been very successful. More than half of all British scientific research is now published under open access terms: either freely available from the moment of publication, or paywalled for a year or more so that the publishers can make a profit before being placed on general release.

　　6) Yet the new system has not worked out any cheaper for the universities. Publishers have responded to the demand that they make their product free to readers by charging their writers fees to cover the costs of preparing an article. These range from around ?500 to $5,000. A report last year pointed out that the costs both of subscriptions and of these “article preparation costs" had been steadily rising at a rate above inflation. In some ways the scientific publishing model resembles the economy of the social internet: labour is provided free in exchange for the hope of status, while huge profits are made by a few big firms who run the market places. In both cases, we need a rebalancing of power.

　　26. Scientific publishing is seen as “a license to print money” partly because

　　[A] its funding has enjoyed a steady increase.

　　[B] its marketing strategy has been successful.

　　[C] its payment for peer review is reduced.

　　[D] its content acquisition costs nothing.

　　27. According to Paragraphs 2 and 3, scientific publishers Elsevier have

　　[A] thrived mainly on university libraries.

　　[B] gone through an existential crisis.

　　[C] revived the publishing industry.

　　[D] financed researchers generously.

　　28. How does the author feel about the success of Sci-Hub?

　　[A] Relieved.

　　[B] Puzzled.

　　[C] Concerned.

　　[D] Encouraged.

　　29. It can be learned from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that open access terms.

　　[A] allow publishers some room to make money.

　　[B] render publishing much easier for scientists.

　　[C] reduce the cost of publication substantially

　　[D] free universities from financial burdens.

　　30. Which of the following characterized the scientific publishing model?

　　[A] Trial subscription is offered.

　　[B] Labour triumphs over status.

　　[C] Costs are well controlled.

　　[D]The few feed on the many.

　　1)  Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their local park. The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley’s world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.

　　2) Parkrun is succeeding where London’s Olympic “legacy” is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run—up to 2012—but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to “inspire a generation.” The success of Parkrun offers answers。

　　3) Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers.

　　4) Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally “grassroots”, concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods—making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education。 Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.

　　21.According to Paragraph1, Parkrun has______.

　　[A] gained great popularity

　　[B] created many jobs

　　[C] strengthened community ties

　　[D] become an official festival

　　22.The author believes that London’s Olympic “legacy” has failed to______.

　　[A] boost population growth

　　[B] promote sport participation

　　[C] improve the city’s image

　　[D] increase sport hours in schools

　　23.Parkrun is different from Olympic games in that it______.

　　[A] aims at discovering talents

　　[B] focuses on mass competition

　　[C] does not emphasize elitism

　　[D] does not attract first-timers

　　24.With regard to mass sport, the author holds that governments should______.

　　[A] organize “grassroots” sports events

　　[B] supervise local sports associations

　　[C] increase funds for sports clubs

　　[D] invest in public sports facilities

　　25.The author’s attitude to what UK governments have done for sports is______.

　　[A] tolerant

　　[B] critical

1)  For years, studies have found that first-generation college students-those who do not have a parent with a college degree-lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created "a paradox" in that recruiting first-generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has "continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close" achievement gap based on social class, according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science.

　　2)  But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach (which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap (measured by such factors as grades) between first-generation and other students.

　　3)  The authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findings are based on a study involving 147 students(who completed the project)at an unnamed private university．First generation was defined as not having a parent with a four-year college degree Most of the first-generation students(59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell Grants，a federal g rant for undergraduates with financial need，while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students with at least one parent with a four-year degree

　　4) Their thesis-that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact-was based on the view that first-gene ration students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be narrowed to close the achievement gap.

　　5) Many first-gene ration students “struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education，learn the 'rules of the game，'and take advantage of college resources," they write And this becomes more of a problem when collages don't talk about the class advantage and disadvantages of different groups of students Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students' educational experience，many first-gene ration students lack sight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students' like them can improve.

　　26. Recruiting more first-generation students has_____.

　　[A] reduced their dropout rates

　　[B] narrowed the achievement gap

　　[C] missed its original purpose

　　[D] depressed college students

　　27 The authors of the research article are optimistic because_____.

　　[A] their finding appeal to students

　　[B] the recruiting rate has increased

　　[C] the problem is solvable

　　[D] their approach is costless

　　28 The study suggests that most first-generation students_____.

　　[A] are from single-parent families

　　[B] study at private universities

　　[C] are in need of financial support

　　[D] have failed their collage

　　29. The author of the paper believe that first-generation students _____.

　　[A] may lack opportunities to apply for research projects

　　[B] are inexperienced in handling their issues at college

　　[C] can have a potential influence on other students

　　[D] are actually indifferent to the achievement gap

　　30.We may infer from the last paragraph that_____.

　　[A]universities often reject the culture of the middle-class

　　[B]students are usually to blame for their lack of resources

　　[C]social class greatly helps enrich educational experiences

　　[D]colleges are partly responsible for the problem in question

　　1) Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.

　　2) Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.

　　3) Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.

　　4) From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.

　　5) Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher climb than earlier generations in reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.

　　6) Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-yaear-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs, says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said.” I can’t afford to pay ma monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to mark that happen.” Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. “I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn’t have college degrees,” Schneider said. “I don’t think people are capable of that anymore.”

　　36. One cross-generation mark of a successful life is_____.

　　[A] trying out different lifestyles

　　[B] having a family with children

　　[C] working beyond retirement age

　　[D] setting up a profitable business

　　37. It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that young people tend to____.

　　[A] favor a slower life pace

　　[B] hold an occupation longer

　　[C] attach importance to pre-marital finance

　　[D] give priority to childcare outside the home

　　38. The priorities and expectations defined by the young will____.

　　[A] become increasingly clear

　　[B] focus on materialistic issues

　　[C] depend largely on political preferences

　　[D] reach almost all aspects of American life

　　39. Both young and old agree that____.

　　[A] good-paying jobs are less available

　　[B] the old made more life achievements

　　[C] housing loans today are easy to obtain

　　[D] getting established is harder for the young

　　40. Which of the following is true about Schneider？

　　[A] He found a dream job after graduating from college.

　　[B] His parents believe working steadily is a must for success.

　　[C] His parents’ good life has little to do with a college degree.

　　[D] He thinks his job as a technician quite challenging.

　　1) Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.

　　2) California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling particularly one that upsets the old assumption that authorities may search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.

　　3) The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California’s advice. Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justices can and should provide updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.

　　4) They should start by discarding California’s lame argument that exploring the contents of a smart phone — a vast storehouse of digital information — is similar to, say, rifling through a suspect’s purse. The court has ruled that police don’t violate the Fourth Amendment when they sift through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a warrant. But exploring one’s smart phone is more like entering his or her home. A smart phone may contain an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The development of “cloud computing,” meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.

　　5) Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. But keeping sensitive information on these devices is increasingly a requirement of normal life. Citizens still have a right to expect private documents to remain private and protected by the Constitution’s prohibition on unreasonable searches.

　　6) As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn’t ease the challenge of line-drawing. In many cases, it would not be overly onerous for authorities to obtain a warrant to search through phone contents. They could still invalidate Fourth Amendment protections when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they could take reasonable measures to ensure that phone data are not erased or altered while a warrant is pending. The court, though, may want to allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to more freedom.

　　7) But the justices should not swallow California’s argument whole. New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protections. Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now.

　　26. The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to_____.

　　[A] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.

　　[B] search for suspects’ mobile phones without a warrant.

　　[C] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized.

　　[D]prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.

　　27. The author’s attitude toward California’s argument is one of_____.

　　[A] disapproval.

　　[B] indifference.

　　[C] tolerance.

　　[D]cautiousness.

　　28. The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to_____.

　　[A] getting into one’s residence.

　　[B] handling one’s historical records.

　　[C] scanning one’s correspondences.

　　[D] going through one’s wallet.

　　29. In Paragraph 5 and 6， the author shows his concern that_____.

　　[A] principles are hard to be clearly expressed.

　　[B] the court is giving police less room for action.

　　[C] citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected.

　　[D] phones are used to store sensitive information.

　　30. Orin Kerr’s comparison is quoted to indicate that_____.

　　[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly.

　　[B] new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution.

　　[C]California’s argument violates principles of the Constitution.

　　[D]principles of the Constitution should never be altered.

　　1)  It is curious that Stephen Koziatek feels almost as though he has to justify his efforts to give his students a better future.

　　2)  Mr. Koziatek is part of something pioneering. He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and mechanical memorization, but practical. When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the 13th president of the United States but be utterly overwhelmed by a broken bike Chain?

　　3)  As Koziatek know, there is learning in just about everything. Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum. They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle.

　　4)  But he’s also found a kind of insidious prejudice. Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority. School in the family of vocational education “have that stereotype...that it’s for kids who can’t make it academically,” he says.

　　5)  On one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America’s evolution. Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was. The job security that the US economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated. More education is the new principle. We want more for our kids, and rightfully so.

　　6)  But the headlong push into bachelor’s degrees for all—and the subtle devaluing of anything less—misses an important point: That’s not the only thing the American economy needs. Yes, a bachelor’s degree opens more doors. But even now, 54 percent of the jobs in the country are middle-skill jobs, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. But only 44 percent of workers are adequately trained.

　　7)  In other words, at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head, frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing, one obvious solution is staring us in the face. There is a gap in working-class jobs, but the workers who need those jobs most aren’t equipped to do them. Koziatek’s Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap.

　　8)  Koziatek’s school is a wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, it risks overlooking a nation’s diversity of gifts.

　　21. A broken bike chain is mentioned to show students’ lack of_____.

　　[A] practical ability

　　[B] academic training

　　[C] pioneering spirit

　　[D] mechanical memorization

　　22. There exists the prejudice that vocational education is for kids who_____.

　　[A] have a stereotyped mind

　　[B] have no career motivation

　　[C] are not academically successful

　　[D] are financially disadvantaged

　　23. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that high school graduates_____.

　　[A] used to have big financial concerns

　　[B] used to have more job opportunities

　　[C] are reluctant to work in manufacturing

　　[D] are entitled to more educational privileges

　　24. The headlong push into bachelor’s degrees for all_____.

　　[A] helps create a lot of middle-skill jobs

　　[B] may narrow the gap in working-class jobs

　　[C] is expected to yield a better-trained workforce

　　[D] indicates the overvaluing of higher education

　　25. The author’s attitude toward Koziatek’s school can be described as_____.

　　[A] supportive

　　[B] tolerant

　　[C] disappointed

　　[D] cautious

　　1) In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work. But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context of our unique life experience. Prior knowledge and interest influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.

　　2) Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility process, through which the individual researcher’s me, here, now becomes the community’s anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.

　　3) Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. Within the complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim works it through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual’s discovery claim into the community’s credible discovery.

　　4) Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing Knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. The goal is new-search, not re-search. Not surprisingly, newly published discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future researchers. Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi once described discovery as “seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” But thinking what nobody else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change their views. Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.

　　5) In the end, credibility “happens” to a discovery claim - a process that corresponds to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. “We reason together, challenge, revise, and complete each other’s reasoning and each other’s conceptions of reason.”

　　31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is characterized by its _____.

　　[A] uncertainty and complexity.

　　[B] misconception and deceptiveness.

　　[C] logicality and objectivity.

　　[D] systematicness and regularity.

　　32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that credibility process requires _____.

　　[A] strict inspection.

　　[B] shared efforts.

　　[C] individual wisdom.

　　[D] persistent innovation.

　　33.Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it _____.

　　[A] has attracted the attention of the general public.

　　[B] has been examined by the scientific community.

　　[C] has received recognition from editors and reviewers.

　　[D] has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.

　　34. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi would most likely agree that _____.

　　[A] scientific claims will survive challenges.

　　[B] discoveries today inspire future research.

　　[C] efforts to make discoveries are justified.

　　[D] scientific work calls for a critical mind.

　　35.Which of the following would be the best title of the test?

　　[A] Novelty as an Engine of Scientific Development.

　　[B] Collective Scrutiny in Scientific Discovery.

　　[C] Evolution of Credibility in Doing Science.

　　[D] Challenge to Credibility at the Gate to Science.

　　1)  An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted—the trouble is, no one knows which half. In the internet age, at least in theory, this fraction can be much reduced. By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim “behavioural” ads at those most likely to buy.

　　2)  In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?

　　3)  In December 2010 America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed adding a “do not track” (DNT) option to internet browsers, so that users could tell advertisers that they did not want to be followed. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari both offer DNT; Google’s Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responding to DNT requests.

　　4)  On May 31st Microsoft set off the row. It said that Internet Explorer 10, the version due to appear with windows 8, would have DNT as a default.

　　5)  Advertisers are horrified. Human nature being what it is, most people stick with default settings. Few switch DNT on now, but if tracking is off it will stay off. Bob Liodice, the chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, says consumers will be worse off if the industry cannot collect information about their preferences. People will not get fewer ads, he says. “They’ll get less meaningful, less targeted ads.”

　　6)  It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Getting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.

　　7)  Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. After all, it has an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on advertising, it has chosen an indirect method: There is no guarantee that DNT by default will become the norm. DNT does not seem an obviously huge selling point for windows 8—though the firm has compared some of its other products favourably with Google’s on that count before. Brendon Lynch, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, blogged: “We believe consumers should have more control.” Could it really be that simple?

　　26. It is suggested in Paragraph 1 that “behavioural” ads help advertisers to _____.

　　[A] ease competition among themselves.

　　[B] lower their operational costs.

　　[C] avoid complaints from consumers.

　　[D] provide better online services.

　　27. “The industry” (Para.3) refers to _____.

　　[A] online advertisers.

　　[B] e-commerce conductors.

　　[C] digital information analysis.

　　[D] internet browser developers.

　　28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default.

　　[A] may cut the number of junk ads.

　　[B] fails to affect the ad industry.

　　[C] will not benefit consumers.

　　[D] goes against human nature.

　　29. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 6?

　　[A] DNT may not serve its intended purpose.

　　[B] Advertisers are willing to implement DNT.

　　[C] DNT is losing its popularity among consumers.

　　[D] Advertisers are obliged to offer behavioural ads.

　　30. The author's attitude towards what Brendon Lynch said in his blog is one of _____.

　　[A] indulgence.

　　[B] understanding.

　　[C] appreciation.

　　[D] skepticism.

　　1) Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens---a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands—once lent red to the often grey landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species’ historic range.

　　2) The crash was a major reason the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service （USFWS）decided to formally list the bird as threatened. “The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation,” said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as “endangered,” a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats. But Ashe and others argued that the “threatened” tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken’s habitat.

　　3) Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range—wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat, USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let “states” remain in the driver’s seat for managing the species，” Ashe said.

　　4) Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not surprisingly, industry groups and states generally argue it goes too far; environmentalists say it doesn’t go far enough “The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction,” says biologist Jay Lininger.

　　26. The major reason for listing the lesser prairie as threatened is____.

　　[A] its drastically decreased population

　　[B] the underestimate of the grassland acreage

　　[C] a desperate appeal from some biologists

　　[D] the insistence of private landowners

　　27.The “threatened” tag disappointed some environmentalists in that it____.

　　[A] was a give-in to governmental pressure

　　[B] would involve fewer agencies in action

　　[C] granted less federal regulatory power

　　[D] went against conservation policies

　　28.It can be learned from Paragraph3 that unintentional harm-doers will not be prosecuted if they_____.

　　[A] agree to pay a sum for compensation

　　[B] volunteer to set up an equally big habitat

　　[C] offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job

　　[D] promise to raise funds for USFWS operations

　　29.According to Ashe， the leading role in managing the species in_____.

　　[A] the federal government

　　[B] the wildlife agencies

　　[C] the landowners

　　[D] the states

　　30.Jay Lininger would most likely support_____.

　　[A] industry groups

　　[B] the win-win rhetoric

　　[C] environmental groups

　　[D] the plan under challenge

From the early days of broadband, advocates for consumers and web-based companies worried that the cable and phone companies selling broadband connections had the power and incentive to favor affiliated websites over their rivals’. That’s why there has been such a strong demand for rules that would prevent broadband providers from picking winners and losers online, preserving the freedom and innovation that have been the lifeblood of the internet.

Yet that demand has been almost impossible to fill—in part because of pushback from broadband providers, anti-regulatory conservatives and the courts. A federal appeals court weighed in again Tuesday, but instead of providing a badly needed resolution, it only prolonged the fight. At issue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was the latest take of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on net neutrality, adopted on a party-line vote in 2017. The Republican-penned order not only eliminated the strict net neutrality rules the FCC had adopted when it had a Democratic majority in 2015, but rejected the commission’s authority to require broadband providers to do much of anything. The order also declared that state and local governments couldn’t regulate broadband providers either.

The commission argued that the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice would protect against anti-competitive behavior, such as a broadband-providing conglomerate like AT&T favoring its own video-streaming service at the expense of Netflix and Apple TV. Yet the FCC also ended the investigations of broadband providers that imposed data caps on their rivals’ streaming services but not their own.

On Tuesday, the appeals court unanimously upheld the 2017 order deregulating broadband providers, citing a Supreme Court ruling from 2005 that upheld a similarly deregulatory move. But Judge Patricia Millett rightly argued in a concurring opinion that “the result is unhinged from the realities of modern broadband service,” and said Congress or the Supreme Court could intervene to “avoid trapping Internet regulation in technological anachronism.”

In the meantime, the court threw out the FCC’s attempt to block all state rules on net neutrality, while preserving the commission’s power to preempt individual state laws that undermine its order. That means more battles like the one now going on between the Justice Department and California, which enacted a tough net neutrality law in the wake of the FCC’s abdication.

The endless legal battles and back-and-forth at the FCC cry out for Congress to act. It needs to give the commission explicit authority once and for all to bar broadband providers from meddling in the traffic on their network and to create clear rules protecting openness and innovation online.

36. There has long been concern that broadband providers would ______.

A.  bring web-based firms under control

B.  slow down the traffic on their network

C.  show partiality in treating clients

D.  intensify competition with their rivals

37. Faced with the demand for net neutrality rules, the FCC ______.

A.  sticks to an out-of-date order

B.  takes an anti-regulatory stance

C.  has issued a special resolution

D.  has allowed the states to intervene

38. What can be learned about AT&T from Paragraph 3?

A.  It protects against unfair competition.

B.It engages in anti-competitive practices.

C.  It is under the FCC’s investigation.

D.  It is in pursuit of quality service.

39. Judge Patricia Millett argues that the appeals court’s decision ______.

A.  focuses on trivialities

B.  conveys an ambiguous message

C.  is at odds with its earlier rulings

D.  is out of touch with reality

40. What does the author argue in the last paragraph?

A.  Congress needs to take action to ensure net neutrality.

B.  The FCC should be put under strict supervision.

C.  Rules need to be set to diversify online services.

D.  Broadband providers’ rights should be protected.

Last year marked the third year in a row of when Indonesia’s bleak rate of deforestation has slowed in pace. One reason for the turnaround may be the country’s antipoverty program.

In 2007, Indonesia started phasing in a program that gives money to its poorest residents under certain conditions, such as requiring people to keep kids in school or get regular medical care. Called conditional cash transfers or CCTs, these social assistance programs are designed to reduce inequality and break the cycle of poverty. ... In Indonesia, the program has provided enough food and medicine to substantially reduce severe growth problems among children.

But CCT programs don’t generally consider effects on the environment. In fact, poverty alleviation and environmental protection are often viewed as conflicting goals, says Paul Ferraro, an economist at Johns Hopkins University.

That’s because economic growth can be correlated with environmental degradation, while protecting the environment is sometimes correlated with greater poverty. However, those correlations don’t prove cause and effect. The only previous study analyzing causality, based on an area in Mexico that had instituted CCTs, supported the traditional view. There, as people got more money, some of them may have more cleared land for cattle to raise for meat, Ferraro says.

Such programs do not have to negatively affect the environment, though. Ferraro wanted to see if Indonesia’s poverty-alleviation program was affecting deforestation. ...

Ferraro analyzed satellite data showing annual forest loss from 2008 to 2012—including during Indonesia’s phase-in of the antipoverty program—in 7,468 forested villages across 15 provinces and multiple islands. Ferraro separated the effects of the CCT program on forest loss from other factors, ..., “we see that the program is associated with a 30 percent reduction in deforestation,” Ferraro says.

That’s likely because the rural poor are using the money as makeshift insurance policies against inclement weather, Ferraro says. Typically, if rains are delayed, people may clear land to plant more rice to supplement their harvests. With the CCTs, individuals instead can use the money to supplement their harvests.

Whether this research translates elsewhere is anybody’s guess. Ferraro suggests their results may transfer to other parts of Asia, due to commonalities such as the importance of growing rice and market access. And regardless of transferability, the study shows that what’s good for people may also be good for the environment, Ferraro says. Even if this program didn’t reduce poverty, he says, “the value of the avoided deforestation just for carbon dioxide emissions alone is more than the program costs.”

26. According to the first two paragraphs, CCT programs aim to ______.

A.  facilitate health care reform

B.  help poor families get better off

C.  improve local education systems

D.  lower deforestation rates

27. The study based on an area in Mexico is cited to show that ______.

A.  cattle rearing has been a major means of livelihood for the poor

B.  CCT programs have helped preserve traditional lifestyles

C.  antipoverty efforts require the participation of local farmers

D.  economic growth tends to cause environmental degradation

28. In his study about Indonesia, Ferraro intends to find out ______.

A.  its acceptance level of CCTs

B.  its annual rate of poverty alleviation

C.  the relation of CCTs to its forest loss

D.  the role of its forests in climate change

29. According to Ferraro, the CCT program in Indonesia is most valuable in that ______.

A.  it will benefit other Asian countries

B.  it will reduce regional inequality

C.  it can protect the environment

D.  it can boost grain production

30. What is the text centered on?

A.  The effects of a program.

B.  The debates over a program.

C.  The process of a study.

　　1)  Grade inflation--the gradual increase in average GPAs (grade-point averages) over the past few decades-is often considered a product of a consumer era in higher education, in which students are treated like customers to be pleased. But another, related force-a policy often buried deep in course catalogs called “grade forgiveness”-is helping raise GPAs.

　　2) Grade forgiveness allows students to retake a course in which they received a low grade, and the most recent grade or the highest grade is the only one that counts in calculating a student’s overall GPA.

　　3) The use of this little-known practice has accelerated in recent years, as colleges continue to do their utmost to keep students in school (and paying tuition) and improve their graduation rates. When this practice first started decades ago, it was usually limited to freshmen, to give them a second chance to take a class in their first year if they struggled in their transition to college-level courses. But now most colleges save for many selective campuses, allow all undergraduates, and even graduate students, to get their low grades forgiven.

　　4) College officials tend to emphasize that the goal of grade forgiveness is less about the grade itself and more about encouraging students to retake courses critical to their degree program and graduation without incurring a big penalty. “Untimely,” said Jack Miner, Ohio State University’s registrar, “we see students achieve more success because they retake a course and do better in subsequent contents or master the content that allows them to graduate on time.”

　　5) That said, there is a way in which grade forgiveness satisfies colleges’ own needs as well. For public institutions, state funds are sometimes tied partly to their success on metrics such as graduation rates and student retention-so better grades can, by boosting figures like those, mean more money. And anything that raises GPAs will likely make students-who, at the end of the day, are paying the bill-feel they’ve gotten a better value for their tuition dollars, which is another big concern for colleges.

　　6) Indeed, grade forgiveness is just another way that universities are responding to consumers’ expectations for higher education. Since students and parents expect a college degree to lead a job, it is in the best interest of a school to turn out graduates who are as qualified as possible-or at least appear to be. On this, students’ and colleges’ incentives seem to be aligned.

　　26. What is commonly regarded as the cause of grade inflation?

　　[A] The change of course catalogs.

　　[B] Students’ indifference to GPAS.

　　[C] Colleges’ neglect of GPAS.

　　[D] The influence of consumer culture.

　　27. What was the original purpose of grade forgiveness?

　　[A] To help freshmen adapt to college learning.

　　[B] To maintain colleges’ graduation rates.

　　[C] To prepare graduates for a challenging future.

　　[D] To increase universities’ income from tuition.

　　28. According to Paragraph 5, grade forgiveness enable colleges to_____.

　　[A] obtain more financial support

　　[B] boost their student enrollments

　　[C] improve their teaching quality

　　[D] meet local governments’ needs

　　29. What does the phrase “to be aligned”(Para.6) most probably mean?

　　[A] To counterbalance each other.

　　[B] To complement each other.

　　[C] To be identical with each other.

　　[D] To be contradictory to each other.

　　30. The author examines the practice of grade forgiveness by_____.

　　[A] assessing its feasibility

　　[B] analyzing the causes behind it

　　[C] comparing different views on it

　　[D] listing its long-run effects

　　1）Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars. Seven months and one election day later, a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of the clean air zone, a first step toward its possible demise.

　　2）Mayor Jose Luis Martínez-Almeida made opposition to the zone a centrepiece of his election campaign, despite its success in improving air quality. A judge has now overruled the city's decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. But with legal battles ahead, the zone's future looks uncertain at best.

　　3）Among other weaknesses, the measures cities must employ when left to tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious, and therefore vulnerable. That’s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers—who must pay fees or buy better vehicles—rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution.

　　4）It’s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London. The new ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue in next year's mayoral election. And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected.

　　5）It's not that measures such as London’s Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents' health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits - fewer heart attacks, stokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. Fewer untimely deaths.

　　6）But mayors and councilors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town. They are acting because national governments — Britain’s and others across Europe—have failed to do so.

　　7）Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas—city centres,“school streets”, even individual roads-are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles into compliance. Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimise pollution. We re doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars.

　　31. Which of the following is true about Madrid’s clean air zone?

　　[A] Its effects are questionable

　　[B] It has been opposed by a judge

　　[C] It needs tougher enforcement

　　[D] Its fate is yet to be decided

　　32. Which is considered a weakness of the city-level measures to tackle dirty air?

　　[A] They are biased against car manufacturers.

　　[B] They prove impractical for city councils.

　　[C] They are deemed too mild for politicians.

　　[D] They put too much burden on individual motorists.

　　33. The author believes that the extension of London’s Ulez will .

　　[A] arouse strong resistance.

　　[B] ensure Khan’s electoral success.

　　[C] improve the city’s traffic.

　　[D] discourage car manufacturing.

　　34. Who does the author think should have addressed the problem?

　　[A] Local residents

　　[B] Mayors.

　　[C] Councilors.

　　[D] National governments.

　　35. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that auto companies .

　　[A] will raise low-emission car production

　　[B] should be forced to follow regulations

　　[C] will upgrade the design of their vehicles

　　[D] should be put under public supervision

　　1）It is true that CEO pay has gone up-top ones may make 300 times the pay of typical workers on average, and since the mid-1970s CEO pay for large publicly traded American corporations has, by varying estimates, gone up by about 500% The typical CEO of a top American corporation now makes about S18.9 million a year.

　　2）The best model for understanding the growth of CEO pay is that of limited CEO talent in a world where business opportunities for the top firms are growing rapidly. The efforts of America's highest-earning 1% have been one of the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It's not popular to say, but one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy.

　　3）Today's CEO, at least for major American firms, must have many mere skills than simply being able to“run the company" CEOs must have a good sense of financial markets and maybe even how the company should trade in them. They also need better public relations skills than their predecessors, as the costs of even a minor slipup can be significant. Then there' s the fact that large American companies are much more globalized than ever before, with supply chains spread across a larger number of countries. To lead in that system requires knowledge that is fairly mind-boggling plus, virtually all major American companies are beyond this major CEOs still have to do all the day-to-day work they have always done.

　　4）The common idea that high CEO pay is mainly about ripping people off doesn't explain history very well. By most measures, corporate governance has become a lot tighter and more rigorous since the 1970s. Yet it is principally during this period of stronger governance that CEO pay has been high and rising. That suggests it is in the broader corporate interest to recruit top candidates for increasingly tough jobs.”

　　5）Furthermore, the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside candidates, not to the cozy insider picks, another sign that high CEO pay is not some kind of depredation at the expense of the rest of the company. And the stock market reacts positively when companies tie CEO pay, to say, stock prices, a sign that those practices build up corporate value not just for the CEO.

　　26. Which of the following has contributed to CEO pay rise?

　　[A] The growth in the number of corporations

　　[B] The general pay rise with a better economy

　　[C] Increased business opportunities for top firms

　　[D] Close cooperation among leading economies

　　27. Compared with their predecessors, today's CEOs are required to______

　　[A] foster a stronger sense of teamwork

　　[B] finance more research and development

　　[C] establish closer ties with tech companies

　　[D] operate more globalized companies

　　28. CEO pay has been rising since the 1970s despite______

　　[A] continual internal opposition

　　[B] strict corporate governance

　　[C] conservative business strategies

　　[D] Repeated government warnings

　　29. High CEO pay can be justified by the fact that it helps______

　　[A] confirm the status of CEOs

　　[B] motivate inside candidates

　　[C] boost the efficiency of CEOs

　　[D] increase corporate value

　　30. The most suitable title for this text would be______

　　[A] CEOs Are Not Overpaid

　　[B] CEO Pay: Past and Present

　　[C] CEOs' challenges of Today

　　[D] CEO Traits: Not Easy to Define

In a rare unammous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the 
corruption conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. But it did 
so while holding its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which included accepting 
gifts such as a Rolex watch and a Ferrari automobile from a company seeking 
access to government. 
The high court's decision said the judge in Mr. McDonnell's trial failed to tell 
a jury that it must look only at his "official acts," or the former governor's decisions 
on "specific" and "unsettled" issues related to his duties. 
Merely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless done with 
clear intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, the justices found. 
The court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening doors is 
"distasteful" and "nasty." But under anti-bribery laws, proof must be made of 
concrete benefits, such as approval of a contract or regulation. Simply arranging a 
meeting, making a phone call, or hosting an event is not an "official act". 
The court's ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of favoritism that is not 
criminal. Elected leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with 
bureaucratic problems without fear of prosecution for bribery. "The basic compact 
underlying representative government," wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the 
court, "assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act on 
their concerns." 
But the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected representatives, 
not the courts, to ensure equality of access to government. Officials must not be 
allowed to play favorites in providing information or in arranging meetings 
simply because an individual or group provides a campaign donation or a personal 
gift. This type of integrity requires well-enforced laws in government transparency, 
such as records of official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information about 
each elected leader's source of wealth. 
Favoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of corruption. But it is 
not always corruption. Rather officials must avoid double standards, or different 
types of access for average people and the wealthy. If connections can be 
bought, a basic premise of democratic society - that all are equal in treatment by 
government - is undermined. Good governance rests on an understanding of the 
inherent worth of each individual. 
The court's ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both corruption and 
official favoritism.

36. The underlined sentence (Para.I) most probably shows that the court 
[A] avoided defining the extent of McDonnell's duties. 
[B] made no compromise in convicting McDonnell.

[D] refused to comment on McDonnell's ethics. 
 
37. According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive only if it involves 
[A] leaking secrets intentionally. 
[B] sizable gains in the form ofgifts. 
[C] concrete returns for gift-givers. 
[D] breaking contracts officially.

　　1) Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it’s just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.

　　2) Unfortunately, banks’ lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.

　　3) After a bruising encounter with Congress, America’s Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB’s chairman, cried out against those who “question our motives.” Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobbying group politely calls “the use of judgment by management.”

　　4) European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did “not live in a political vacuum” but “in the real word” and that Europe could yet develop different rules.

　　5) It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known for years. But bank’s shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.

　　6) To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America’s new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.

　　36. Bankers complained that they were forced to________.

　　[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules

　　[B] collect payments from third parties

　　[C] cooperate with the price managers

　　[D] reevaluate some of their assets.

　　37.According to the author, the rule changes of the FASB may result in________.

　　[A] the diminishing role of management

　　[B] the revival of the banking system

　　[C] the banks’ long-term asset losses

　　[D] the weakening of its independence

　　38.According to Paragraph 4, McCreevy objects to the IASB’s attempt to________.

　　[A] keep away from political influences.

　　[B] evade the pressure from their peers.

　　[C] act on their own in rule-setting.

　　[D] take gradual measures in reform.

　　39.The author thinks the banks were “on the wrong planet ”in that they

　　[A] misinterpreted market price indicators

　　[B] exaggerated the real value of their assets

　　[C] neglected the likely existence of bad debts.

　　[D] denied booking losses in their sale of assets.

　　40.The author’s attitude towards standard-setters is one of________.

　　[A] satisfaction.

　　[B] skepticism.

　　[C] objectiveness

　　[D] sympathy

　　1) The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.

　　2) What’s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.

　　3)  The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers in research.

　　4)  As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science prizes—both new and old—are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include. But the Nobel Foundation’s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research—as will be demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.

　　5) As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.

　　31.The Fundamental Physical Prize is seen as_____.

　　[A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’s wealth.

　　[B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prize.

　　[C]an example of bankers’ investment.

　　[D]a handsome reward for researchers.

　　32.The critics think that the new awards will most benefit_____.

　　[A]the profit-oriented scientists.

　　[B]the founders of the new award.

　　[C]the achievement-based system.

　　[D]peer-review-led research.

　　33.The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves_____.

　　[A]controversies over the recipients’ status.

　　[B]the joint effort of modern researchers.

　　[C]legitimate concerns over the new prize.

　　[D]the demonstration of research findings.

　　34.According to Paragraph 4, which of the following is true of the Nobels?

　　[A] Their endurance has done justice to them.

　　[B] Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.

　　[C] They are the most representative honor.

　　[D] History has never cast doubt on them.

　　35.The author believes that the new awards are_____.

　　[A]acceptable despite the criticism.

　　[B]harmful to the culture of research.

　　[C]subject to undesirable changes.

　　[D]unworthy of public attention.

First two hours, now three hours - this is how far in advance authorities are 
recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. 
airports with increasingly massive security lines. 
Americans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security procedures in return 
for increased safety. The crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, which terrorists may have 
downed over the Mediterranean Sea, provides another tragic reminder of why. But 
demanding too much of air travelers or providing too little security in return 
undermines public support for the process. And it should: Wasted time is a drag on 
Americans' economic and private lives, not to mention infuriating. 
Last year, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found in a secret 
check that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons - both fake and 
real - past airport security nearly every time they tried. Enhanced security 
measures since then, combined with a rise in airline travel due to the improving 
economy and low oil prices, have resulted in long waits at major airports such as 
Chicago's O'Hare International. It is not yet clear how much more effective airline 
security has become - but the lines are obvious. 
Part of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the steep increase in 
airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. Part of the 
issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. Another factor 
may be that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked- 
baggage fees, though the airlines strongly dispute this. 
There is one step the TSA could take that would not require remodeling airports 
or rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the PreCheck program. PreCheck is 
supposed to be a win-win for travelers and the TSA. Passengers who pass a 
background check are eligible to use expedited screening lanes. This allows the TSA 
to focus on travelers who are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. The 
TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in PreCheck. 
It has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is sticker shock: 
Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. 
Since the beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck's fatal flaw. Upcoming 
reforms might bring the price to a more reasonable level. But Congress should 
look into doing so directly, by helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut 
costs in other ways. 
The TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck lanes 
while most of the traveling public suffers in unnecessary lines. It is long past time to 
make the program work.

　　1) That everyone’s too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully： There’s never any time to read.

　　2) What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don’t seem sufficient. The web’s full of articles offering tips on making time to read: “Give up TV” or “Carry a book with you at all times” But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn’t work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you’re so exhausted that a challenging book’s the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, “is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication…It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption”. Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can’t be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.

　　3) In fact, “becoming more efficient” is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you’ll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. “The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,” writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and “we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes）as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them”. No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.

　　4) So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You’d think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us “step outside time’s flow” into “soul time”. You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. “Carry a book with you at all times” can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you’re “making time to read,” but just reading, and making time for everything else.

　　31. The usual time-management techniques don’t work because___.

　　[A] what they can offer does not ease the modern mind

　　[B] what challenging books demand is repetitive reading

　　[C] what people often forget is carrying a book with them

　　[D] what deep reading requires cannot be guaranteed

　　32. The “empty bottles” metaphor illustrates that people feel a pressure to___.

　　[A] update their to-do lists

　　[B] make passing time fulfilling

　　[C] carry their plans through

　　[D] pursue carefree reading

　　33. Eberle would agree that scheduling regular times for reading helps___.

　　[A] encourage the efficiency mind-set

　　[B] develop online reading habits

　　[C] promote ritualistic reading

　　[D] achieve immersive reading

　　34. “Carry a book with you at all times” can work if___.

　　[A] reading becomes your primary business of the day

　　[B] all the daily business has been promptly dealt with

　　[C] you are able to drop back to business after reading

　　[D] time can be evenly split for reading and business

　　35. The best title for this text could be___.

　　[A] How to Enjoy Easy Reading

　　[B] How to Find Time to Read

　　[C] How to Set Reading Goals

　　[D] How to Read Extensively

　　1) Among the annoying challenges facing the middle class is one that will probably go unmentioned in the next presidential campaign: What happens when the robots come for their jobs?

　　2) Don't dismiss that possibility entirely. About half of U.S. jobs are at high risk of being automated, according to a University of Oxford study, with the middle class disproportionately squeezed. Lower-income jobs like gardening or day care don't appeal to robots. But many middle-class occupations-trucking, financial advice, software engineering - have aroused their interest, or soon will. The rich own the robots, so they will be fine.

　　3) This isn't to be alarmist. Optimists point out that technological upheaval has benefited workers in the past. The Industrial Revolution didn't go so well for Luddites whose jobs were displaced by mechanized looms, but it eventually raised living standards and created more jobs than it destroyed. Likewise, automation should eventually boost productivity, stimulate demand by driving down prices, and free workers from hard, boring work. But in the medium term, middle-class workers may need a lot of help adjusting.

　　4) The first step, as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in The Second Machine Age, should be rethinking education and job training. Curriculums -from grammar school to college---should evolve to focus less on memorizing facts and more on creativity and complex communication. Vocational schools should do a better job of fostering problem-solving skills and helping students work alongside robots. Online education can supplement the traditional kind. It could make extra training and instruction affordable. Professionals trying to acquire new skills will be able to do so without going into debt.

　　5) The challenge of coping with automation underlines the need for the U.S. to revive its fading business dynamism: Starting new companies must be made easier. In previous eras of drastic technological change, entrepreneurs smoothed the transition by dreaming up ways to combine labor and machines. The best uses of 3D printers and virtual reality haven't been invented yet. The U.S. needs the new companies that will invent them.

　　6) Finally, because automation threatens to widen the gap between capital income and labor income, taxes and the safety net will have to be rethought. Taxes on low-wage labor need to be cut, and wage subsidies such as the earned income tax credit should be expanded: This would boost incomes, encourage work, reward companies for job creation, and reduce inequality.

　　7) Technology will improve society in ways big and small over the next few years, yet this will be little comfort to those who find their lives and careers upended by automation. Destroying the machines that are coming for our jobs would be nuts. But policies to help workers adapt will be indispensable.

　　21. Who will be most threatened by automation?

　　[A] Leading politicians.

　　[B] Low-wage laborers.

　　[C] Robot owners.

　　[D] Middle-class workers.

　　22. Which of the following best represent the author's view?

　　[A] Worries about automation are in fact groundless.

　　[B] Optimists' opinions on new tech find little support.

　　[C] Issues arising from automation need to be tackled

　　[D] Negative consequences of new tech can be avoided

　　23. Education in the age of automation should put more emphasis on_____.

　　[A] creative potential.

　　[B] job-hunting skills.

　　1) There will eventually come a day when The New York Times ceases to publish stories on newsprint. Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. “Sometime in the future,” the paper’s publisher said back in 2010.

　　2) Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside, there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print. The infrastructure required to make a physical newspaper-printing presses, delivery trucks — isn’t just expensive; it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don’t have the same set of financial constraints. Readers are migrating away from print anyway. And though print and sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts, revenue from print is still declining.

　　3) Overhead may be high and circulation lower, but risking to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake, says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Pere.

　　4) Peretti says the Times shouldn’t waste time getting out of the print business, but only if they go about do, it the right way. “Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them,” he said, “but if you discontinue it, you’re going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you.”

　　5) Sometimes that’s worth making a change anyway. Peretti gives the example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. “It was seen as a blunder,” he said. The move turned out to be foresighted. And if Peretti were in charge at the Times? “I wouldn’t pick a year to end print,” he said. “I would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product.”

　　6) The most loyal customers would still get the product they favor, the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. “So if you are overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping,” Peretti said, “Then increase it at a higher rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue.” In other words, if you’re going to make a print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year — more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.

　　7) “It’s a really hard thing to do and it’s a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn’t have a legacy business,” Peretti remarked. “But we’re going to have questions like that where we have things we’re doing that don’t make sense when the market changes and the world changes. In those situations, it’s better to be more aggressive than less aggressive.”

　　36. The New York Times is considering ending it’s print edition partly due to _____.

　　[A] the high cost of operation

　　[B] the pressure form its investors

　　[C] the complaints from its readers

　　[D] the increasing online ad sales.

　　37.Peretti suggests that.in face of the present situation, the Times should_____.

　　[A] seek new sources of readership

　　[B] end the print edition for good

　　[C] aim for efficient management

　　[D] make strategic adjustments

　　38.It can be inferred front Paragraphs 5 and 6 that a “legacy product” _____.

　　[A] will have the cost of printing reduced.

　　[B] is meant for the most loyal customers.

　　[C] helps restore the glory of former times.

　　[D] expands the popularity of the paper.

　　39. Peretti believes that in a changing world, _____.

　　[A] legacy businesses are becoming outdated.

　　[B] cautiousness facilitates problem-solving.

　　[C] aggressiveness better meets challenges.

　　[D] traditional luxuries can stay unaffected.

　　40 . Which of the following would be the best title of the text ?

　　1) To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy, Cal Newport, author of Deep work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted world, recommends building a habit of “deep work”—the ability to focus without distraction.

　　2) There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work—be it lengthy retreats dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a “journalistic” approach to seizing moments of deep work when you can throughout the day. Whichever approach, the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it.

　　3) Newport also recommends “deep scheduling” to combat constant interruptions and get more done in less time. “At any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar I protect this time like I would a doctor’s appointment or important meeting”, he writes.

　　4)  Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you prioritize your day—in particular how we craft our to-do lists. Tim Harford, author of Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives, points to a study in the early 1980s that divided undergraduates into two groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan activities and goals in much more detail, day by day.

　　5) While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.

　　6) In order to make the most of our focus and energy. We also need to embrace downtime, or as Newport suggests,“be lazy.”

　　7) “Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to be brain as Vitamin D is to the body...[idleness]is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done,”he argues.

　　8) Srini Pillay, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes this counter-intuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate. When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task, they tend to be more efficient.

　　9) “What people don’t realise is that in order to complete these tasks they need to use both the focus and unfocus circuits in their brain”. says Pillay.

　　36. The key to mastering the art of deep work is to _____.

　　[A] keep to your focus time

　　[B] list your immediate tasks

　　[C] make specific daily plans

　　[D] seize every minute to work

　　37. The study in the early 1980s cited by Harford shows that ____.

　　[A] distractions may actually increase efficiency

　　[B] daily schedules are indispensable to studying

　　[C] students are hardly motivated by monthly goals

　　[D] detailed plans many not be as fruitful as expected

　　38. According to Newport, idleness is _____.

　　[A] a desirable mental state for busy people

　　[B] a major contributor to physical health

　　[C] an effective way to save time and energy

　　[D] an essential factor in accomplishing any work

　　39. Pillay believes that our brains’ shift between being focused and unfocused ____.

　　[A] can result in psychological well-being

　　[B] can bring about greater efficiency

　　[C] is aimed at better balance in work

　　[D] is driven by task urgency

　　40. This text is mainly about ____.

　　[A] ways to relieve the tension of busy life

　　[B] approaches to getting more done in less time

　　[C] the key to eliminating distractions

　　[D] the cause of the lack of focus time

　　1) Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist in fire ecology and management.

　　2) In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual budget fighting fires-nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work-such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep-that affect the lives of all Americans.

　　3) Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?

　　4) “It's already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,” he says. We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, “Wait a minute, is this OK?” “Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?”

　　5) Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire, researchers say.

　　6) For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade, the focus has been on climate change-how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires.

　　7) While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn't come at the expense of the rest of the equation.

　　8) “The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both ways,” he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to “an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited.”

　　9) At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws, policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.

　　10) “We've disconnected ourselves from living with fire,” Balch says. “It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.”

　　36.More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in 2015 they_____.

　　[A] exhausted unprecedented management efforts

　　[B] consumed a record-high percentage of budget

　　[C] severely damaged the ecology of western states

　　[D] caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure

　　37.Moritz calls for the use of “a magnifying glass” to _____.

　　[A] raise more funds for fire-prone areas

　　[B] avoid the redirection of federal money

　　[C] find wildfire-free parts of the landscape

　　[D] guarantee safer spending of public funds

　　38.While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that _____.

　　[A] public debates have not settled yet

　　[B] fire-fighting conditions are improving

　　[C] other factors should not be overlooked

　　[D] a shift in the view of fire has taken place

　　39.The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result of failing to _____.

　　[A] discover the fundamental makeup of nature

　　[B] explore the mechanism of the human systems

　　[C] maximize the role of landscape in human life

　　[D] understand the interrelations of man and nature

　　40.Professor Balch points out that fire is something man should _____.

　　[A] do away with

　　[B] come to terms with

　　[C] pay a price for

　　[D] keep away from

　　1) “The ancient Hawaiians were astronomers,” wrote Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii’s last reigning monarch, in 1897. Star watchers were among the most esteemed members of Hawaiian society. Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. Protests have erupted over construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope(TMT), a giant observatory that promises to revolutionize humanity’s view of the cosmos.

　　2) At issue is the TMT’s planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano worshiped by some Hawaiians as the piko that connects the Hawaiian Islands to the heavens. But Mauna Kea is also home to some of the world’s most powerful telescopes. Rested in the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea’s peak rises above the bulk of our planet’s dense atmosphere, where conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of unsurpassed clarity.

　　3) Opposition to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. A small but vocal group of Hawaiians and environments have long viewed their presence as disrespect for sacred land and a painful reminder of the occupation of what was once a sovereign nation.

　　4) Some blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. In their eagerness to build bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is the only way of understanding the world. They did not always prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea’s fragile ecosystems or its holiness to the island’s inhabitants. Hawaiian culture is not a relic of the past; it is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today.

　　5)  Yet science has a cultural history, too, with roots going back to the dawn of civilization. The same curiosity to find what lies beyond the horizon that first brought early Polynesians to Hawaii’s shores inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. Calls to disassemble all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban future development there ignore the reality that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both seek to answer big questions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going. Perhaps that is why we explore the starry skies, as if answering a primal calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral homes.

　　6) The astronomy community is making compromises to change its use of Mauna Kea. The TMT site was chosen to minimize the telescope’s visibility around the island and to avoid archaeological and environmental impact. To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites returned to a natural state. There is no reason why everyone cannot be welcomed on Mauna Kea to embrace their cultural heritage and to study the stars.

　　26. Queen Liliuokalani’s remark in Paragraph 1 indicates___.

　　[A] its conservative view on the historical role of astronomy.

　　[B] the importance of astronomy in ancient Hawaiian society.

　　[C] the regrettable decline of astronomy in ancient times.

　　[D] her appreciation of star watchers’ feats in her time.

　　27. Mauna Kea is deemed as an ideal astronomical site due to

　　[A] its geographical features

　　[B] its protective surroundings.

　　[C] its religious implications.

　　[D] its existing infrastructure.

　　28. The construction of the TMT is opposed by some locals partly because___.

　　[A] it may risk ruining their intellectual life.

　　[B] it reminds them of a humiliating history.

　　[C] their culture will lose a chance of revival.

　　[D] they fear losing control of Mauna Kea.

　　29. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that progress in today’s astronomy___.

　　[A] is fulfilling the dreams of ancient Hawaiians.

　　[B] helps spread Hawaiian culture across the world.

　　[C] may uncover the origin of Hawaiian culture.

　　[D] will eventually soften Hawaiians’ hostility.

　　30. The author’s attitude toward choosing Mauna Kea as the TMT site is one of___.

　　[A] severe criticism.

　　[B] passive acceptance.

　　[C] slight hesitancy.

　　[D] full approval.

　　1) American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years now. Given a multi-year decline in illegal immigration and a similarly sustained pickup in the U.S. job market. The complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for far workers.

　　2) Efforts to create a more straightforward agricultural-workers visa that would enable foreign workers to stay longer in the U. S and change jobs within the industry have so far failed in Congress. If this doesn't change, American businesses, communities and consumers will be the losers.

　　3) Perhaps half of U. S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the U. S, the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today’s farm laborers, while still predominantly born in Mexico, are more likely to be settled, rather than migrating, and more likely to be married than single. They are also aging. At the start of this century, about one-third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now, more than half are. And crop picking is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it has been all along: Native U.S. workers won't be returning to the farm.

　　4) Mechanization is not the answer either----not yet at least. Production of com, cotton, rice, soybeans and wheat have been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries need labor. Even dairy farms, where robots currently do only a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they are automated.

　　5) As a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps in the agricultural workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply: from 2011 to 2016 the number of visas issued more than doubled.

　　6) The H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work, which is limited to 66,000 annually. Even so, employers frequently complain that they aren't allotted all workers they need. The process is cumbersome, expensive and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led H-2A workers to arrive on the job an average of 22 days late. And the shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids, which remove some workers and drive others underground.

　　7) In a 2012 survey, 71 percent of tree-fruit growers and nearly 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor. Some western growers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998-2000, 14.5 percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imported fruit han increased to 25.8 percent.

　　8) In effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.

　　31.  What problem should be addressed according to the first two paragraphs?

　　[A] Discrimination against foreign workers in the U.S.

　　[B] Biased laws in favor of some American businesses.

　　[C] Flaws in U.S. immigration rules for farm workers.

　　[D] Decline of job opportunities U.S. agriculture.

　　32. One trouble with U.S. agricultural workforce is       .

　　[A] the rising number of illegal immigrants

　　[B] the high mobility of crop workers

　　[C] the lack of experienced laborers

　　[D] the aging of immigrant farm workers

　　33.What is the much-argued solution to the labor shortage in U.S. farming?

　　[A] To attract younger laborers to farm work.

　　[B] To get native U.S. workers back to farming.

　　[C] To use more robots to grow high-value crops.

　　[D] To strengthen financial support for farmers.

　　34. Agricultural employers complain about the H-2A visa for its        .

　　[A] slow granting procedures

　　[B] limit on duration of stay

　　[C] tightened requirements

　　[D] control of annual admissions

　　35. Which of the following could be the best title for this text?

　　[A] U.S. Agriculture in Decline?

　　[B] Import Food or Labor?

　　[C] America Saved by Mexico?

　　[D] Manpower vs. Automation?

The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the 
ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the 
standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "so 
much importance attached to intellectual pursuits." According to many books and 
articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an 
unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life. 
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the 
Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church - 
important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of 
southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of 
European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies 
were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of 
civility and virtuosity. 
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education 
and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to 
Massachusetts churches in the decade after 1629, there were political leaders like 
John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he 
journeyed to Boston. These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New 
World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of 
intellectual earnestness. 
We should not forget, however, that most New Englanders were less well 
educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left 
literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully 
intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitious quality. A tailor 
named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for 
leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations, and 
religious hope - all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, 
told his father that the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical 
words: "Come out from among them, touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God 
and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons 
explaining the Bible that he heard in Puritan churches. 
Meanwhile, many settlers had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as 
one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had 
not come to the New World for religion. "Our main end was to catch fish." 

36. The author holds that in the seventeenth-century New England 
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life. 
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged. 
[C] politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors. 
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment. 
 
37. It is suggested in Paragraph 2 that New Englanders 
[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history. 
[B] brought with them the culture of the Old World. 
[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life. 
[D] were obsessed with religious innovations. 
 
38. The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay 
[A] were famous in the New World for their writings. 
[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs. 
[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World. 
[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England. 
 
39. The story of John Dane shows that less well-educated New Englanders were 
often 
[A] influenced by superstitions. 
[B] troubled with religious beliefs. 
[C] puzzled by church sermons. 
[D] frustrated with family earnings. 
 
40. The text suggests that early settlers in New England 
[A] were mostly engaged in political activities. 
[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect. 
[C] came from different intellectual backgrounds. 
[D] left few formal records for later reference.

　　1) In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency,” George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search” scheme. Only if the jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit-and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. What could be more reasonable?

　　2)  More apparent: reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait for the jobseeker’s allowance. “Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on.” he claimed. “We’re doing these things because we know they help people say off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster” Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsides laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness”-protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.

　　3)  Losing a job is hurting:  you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job.

　　4) But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency —permanent dependency if you can get it — supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” — invented in 1996 — is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no mandatory right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ?71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.

　　21. George Osborne’s scheme was intended to_____.

　　[A] provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.

　　[B] encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.

　　[C] motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.

　　[D] guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.

　　22.The phrase “to sign on”( Para.2) most probably means_____.

　　[A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.

　　[B]to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.

　　[C]to register for an allowance from the government.

　　[D]to attend a governmental job-training program.

　　23.What promoted the chancellor to develop his scheme?

　　[A]A desire to secure a better life for all.

　　[B]An eagerness to protect the unemployed.

　　[C]An urge to be generous to the claimants.

　　[D]A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.

　　24.According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel_____.

　　[A]uneasy.

　　[B]enraged.

　　[C]insulted.

　　[D]guilty.

　　25.To which of the following would the author most probably agree?

　　[A] The British welfare system indulges jobseekers’ laziness.

　　[B] Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.

　　[C] The jobseekers’ allowance has met their actual needs.

　　[D] Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.

　　1)  While fossil fuels-coal，oil，gas-still generate roughly 85 percent of the world’s energy supply, it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to renewables is picking up momentum around the world：They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line.

　　2) Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables，especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.

　　3)  In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland，for example，wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world takes the lead，notably China and Europe，the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In March，for the first time，wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US，reported the US Energy Information Administration.

　　4)  President Trump has underlined fossil fuels-especially coal-as the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa，he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play well with many in Iowa，where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state’s electricity generation-and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers.

　　5)  The question“what happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?”has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely.

　　6) The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers，who are placing big bets on battery-powered electric vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years.

　　7)  While there’s a long way to go，the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up-perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate change. What Washington does-or doesn’t do-to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought.

　　26. The word“plummeting”(Para.2)is closest in meaning to_____.

　　[A] stabilizing

　　[B] changing

　　[C] falling

　　[D] rising

　　27. According to Paragraph 3，the use of renewable energy in America_____.

　　[A] is progressing notably

　　[B] is as extensive as in Europe

　　[C] faces many challenges

　　[D] has proved to be impractical

　　28. It can be learned that in Iowa，_____.

　　[A] wind is a widely used energy source

　　[B] wind energy has replaced fossil fuels

　　[C] tech giants are investing in clean energy

　　[D] there is a shortage of clean energy supply

　　29. Which of the following is true about clean energy according to Paragraphs 5&6?

　　[A] Its application has boosted battery storage.

　　[B] It is commonly used in car manufacturing.

　　[C] Its continuous supply is becoming a reality.

　　[D] Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult.

　　30.It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy_____.

　　[A] will bring the US closer to other countries

　　[B] will accelerate global environmental change

　　[C] is not really encouraged by the US government

　　[D] is not competitive enough with regard to its cost

1) When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads, railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.

　　2) Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.

　　3)  Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes.

　　4)  The comprehensives pending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.

　　5) There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.

　　6)  Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.

　　7)  But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing ￡4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in 2015,is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition’s spending plans if returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.

　　8)  While the government’s commitment to long-term funding may have changed, the very pressing need for more affordable housing is real and is not going away.

　　[A] has attracted much attention

"The Heart of the Matter," the just-released report by the American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the 
humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy 
in America. Regrettably, however, the report's failure to address the true nature of 
the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good. 
In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the 
AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by "federal, state and local 
governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others" 
to "maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship 
and education." In response, the American Academy formed the Commission 
on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the commission's 51 members are 
top- tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, 
as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music andjournalism. 
The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because 
representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports 
full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American 
history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. 
To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment 
in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students' ability to solve 
problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for 
teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great 
challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, 
international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs. 
Unfortunately, despite 2½ years in the making, "The Heart of the Matter" 
never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our 
leading colleges and universities. The commission ignores that for several decades 
America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don't know the 
content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, 
the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the 
humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing "progressive," or left- 
liberal propaganda. 
Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and 
progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative 
or classical liberal ideas - such as free markets and self-reliance -  as falling 
outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation. 
The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may 
well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that 
Congress asked it to illuminate. 

   
 
36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author's attitude toward the AAAS's report? 
[A] Critical. 
[B] Appreciative. 
[C] Contemptuous. 
[D] Tolerant. 
 
37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to 
[A] define the government's role in education. 
[B] safeguard individuals' rights to education. 
[C] retain people's interest in liberal education. 
[D] keep a leading position in liberal education. 
 
38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests 
[A] an exclusive study of American history. 
[B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects. 
[C] the application of emerging technologies. 
[D] funding for the study of foreign languages. 
 
39. The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are 
[A] supportive of free markets. 
[B] conservative about public policy. 
[C] biased against classical liberal ideas. 
[D] cautious about intellectual investigation. 
 
40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
[A] Ways to Grasp "The Heart of the Matter" 
[B] Illiberal Education and "The Heart of the Matter" 
[C] The AAAS's Contribution to Liberal Education 
[D] Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education

　　1) Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn't academic.

　　2) But while this may be true, it's not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated "race to the finish line," whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits-in fact, it probably enhances it.

　　3)  Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes-all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders.

　　4) If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn’t surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of the vast academic possibilities that await them in college. Many students find themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on.

　　31. One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a gap year is that_____.

　　[A] they think it academically misleading

　　[B] they have a lot of fun to expect in college

　　[C] it feels strange to do differently from others

　　[D] it seems worthless to take off-campus courses

　　32. Studies from the US and Australia imply that taking a gap year helps_____.

　　[A] keep students from being unrealistic

　　[B] lower risks in choosing careers

　　[C] ease freshmen's financial burdens

　　[D] relieve freshmen of pressures

　　33. The word "acclimation" (Line 8, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to_____.

　　[A] adaptation

　　[B] application

　　[C] motivation

　　[D] competition

　　34. A gap year may save money for students by helping them_____.

　　[A] avoid academic failures

　　[B] establish long-term goals

　　[C] switch to another college

　　[D] decide on the right major

　　35. The most suitable title for this text would be_____.

　　[A] In Favor of the Gap Year

　　[B] The ABCs of the Gap Year

　　[C] The Gap Year Comes Back

　　[D] The Gap Year: A Dilemma
